### My reflection with this assignment was getting the measure offon one part and having to restart, the rest was easy peasy.

### I figured out I am hopless with arduino and have no potential with it at all, every part of the code I needed help with at 1 point or another. I am still trying and am hopfully will start to get it soon.

### I was struggling with figuring out the functions and what to put in them, then I got help from you in office hours and then it went smoothly. I think im starting to get the hang of the arduino, I still need work, but I am steadly improving.

### Dec 11

This week I made A LED turn on every time I put my hand within a certain and turned off when outside that distance.

### This is the code for my arduino.

While doing this I realized the purpose of functions and how much they matter, but I also figured out how to mix and match code I found online.

### Jan 25
