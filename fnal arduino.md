## November 20th

### This week All I did was make a blinking light

### This is my link to the code

### I figured out I am hopless with arduino and have no potential with it at all, every part of the code I needed help with at 1 point or another. I am still trying and am hopfully will start to get it soon.


### December 4th

#### This week I got my hello functions assignment to work by makin the servo spin when my hand got close enough.

### I was struggling with figuring out the functions and what to put in them, then I got help from you in office hours and then it went smoothly. I think im starting to get the hang of the arduino, I still need work, but I am steadly improving.

### Dec 11

This week I made A LED turn on every time I put my hand within a certain and turned off when outside that distance.

### This is the code for my arduino.

While doing this I realized the purpose of functions and how much they matter, but I also figured out how to mix and match code I found online.

### Jan 25

#### I got a partner and made an outline for the project

### This week I learned that having a plan makes everything easier

Update Elliott 2/5 :
This week I worked on coding, and am figuring out how to make the servo turn 360 degrees every time the sensor senses something. 
I learned this week that if somebody has already done something, you can copy them, because you are lazy.

Elliott- I got my wiring done, and am now starting a review on what code I need to edit for this to work correctly. My issue right now is making the 360 turn to push out the candy
(I forgot tinkercad was a thing)

This week I discovered that the sensor doesn't detect something dropping in front of it, so I had to bring it up with Jay in order to edit the design a little bit. I haven't done any work on the code yet, because I had a busy week, in and out of school. With this I learned to test the equipment before making our project, because it might not be able to function the way you want it to.

This week I didn't do anything on my project or code, I had a busy week and could not find time to work on it.

we made backup plans for any problems we find in the future.

-I got injured a week or two before spring break, got surger, but could not find myself at the mental state to work on the project-

3/31 Elliott:
I haven't been doing work on the project because I have been catching up on my other work. I'm planning on having a lot more productivity when i get back from spring break, and maybe run a prototype with jay. A note to self is remember to have the sensor as a number one priority.

I finished the code and its one of these 2
