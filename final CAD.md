## Reflection
When I was doing the assignment I had many set backs such as onshaoe not working, images and link trouble with github and my journal reseting. I learned if I am patient and persistant with what I do I will be more succesful then I wouold originaly. I also learned to get help from more than one sorce and not only rely on what I know, but what others know aswell

### As a reflection of this week I think I shouldnt over think like I did last week and kept putting it off and think of it more simply like I did this week and I can get alot more work done.

### This week I did the dorthy pins because thats all we had assigned

https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/895c1f241ddc66e695ecf0fb/w/f45adf4effe40c9fce92e54d/e/02ba9ebd6e951c51d5699efb


<img src="Images/dorthy pins.png" alt="dorthy pins" width="200" height="200">

### This week was pretty easy, The dorthy pins wernt that hard, and putting it together was satisfying. Overall I enjoyed this week and think it would be fun to do something like this again. I think this week I learned that not everything thats enjoyable has to be challenging.
