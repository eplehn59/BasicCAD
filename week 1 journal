## Reflection
When I was doing the assignment I had many set backs such as onshaoe not working, images and link trouble with github and my journal reseting. I learned if I am patient and persistant with what I do I will be more succesful then I wouold originaly. I also learned to get help from more than one sorce and not only rely on what I know, but what others know aswell.
